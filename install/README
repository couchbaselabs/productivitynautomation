The script will now accept --version in the format x.x.x-yyyy e.g `./cluster_spin.sh up --version 6.6.0-7909`. It pulls packages from http://latestbuilds.build.couchbase.com - note, if you're running it on your local system you'll need to connect to the VPN when bringing clusters up with a specific version so the packages can be downloaded.

The containers will be running ubuntu:18.04 by default, but you can provide an optional --base-image image:tag pair specifying what base image to build the container on to change this (the package name will be derived from the image name:tag) It has been tested with:
    amazonlinux:2
    centos:7
    centos:8
    debian:9
    debian:10
    opensuse/leap:15
    oraclelinux:7
    oraclelinux:8
    ubuntu:16.04
  * ubuntu:18.04 (default)
    ubuntu:20.04

So, an invocation like `./cluster_spin.sh up --version 6.6.0-7909 --base-image oraclelinux:8` will get you to a cluster running on a set of containers based on oraclelinux:8, with the oel8 couchbase-server 6.6.0-7909 package installed.

A little more is happening behind the scenes now (I'd say we outgrew the 'single bash script' idea some time ago, try not to look directly at it), but in a nutshell:

1) If it exists, the existing container image ${prefix}_${clustername} (default: sandbox_cluster) is removed (to avoid situations where some step fails silently in the middle but we think everything's OK because a cluster still manages to come up on the previous image)
2) If --version was specified:
    - A Dockerfile is created in ${workdir} (workdir default = /tmp/cluster-setup-files, or if you'd prefer to keep packages somewhere permanent, use --workdir /foo to set a path)
    - The relevant package for --base-image and --version is downloaded to the workdir
    - The base image is built
3) A docker-compose.yml is created in ${workdir}
4) Containers are brought up
5) Cluster is bootstrapped

Note, my previous disclaimer still applies - although it should do what you need, this script isn't very polished and is potentially quite buggy.
